                    <p>Have you ever stopped to wonder what makes the trees so green? It could be the sun, it could be the soil, it could be both. I am no botanist but I know that the sun plays a major role in the lraves being so green.</p>
    
                    <p> Take this tree for instance. It looks like a shrub but it is actually a super tall tree which I shot from my bedroom window using my DSLR camera. I don't know the specific(name, etc) but I know it sure is a beauty. And it is green. I usually shoot up-close, examining every detail, but not this time. I looked through my window to see this lush lifeform staring at me. I didn't hesitate to capture it's beauty. I wanted to ask why it looked so green and full of life. I did, actually. I didn.t get an answer, maybe it/he/she was very shy. All I know now is that it gets greener by the day. And as the days go by, so do the nights. I wonder if it/he/she will be there tomorrow when I wake up, or will it be in someone's factory.</p> 

                <h2> Sunset By The Beach </h2>

                    <p> Ahh, the beautiful sunset. So calming, so beautiful, so very orange. The skies are beyond beautiful. There's nothing as beautiful as a sunset seen from the top floor of a 5-star boathouse restaurant located on the beach of a magnificent resort. The subtle change from clear skies to a colouring book of possibilities.  </p>
                    
                    
                    <p> When you went to the beach last, do you recall such a captivating sight? Did you by chance get to photograph it? My friend Jen is a photographer who loves all things nature. She is the one responsible for this beautfiul piece of art. As you look at the picture, you see how the sun lights up the sky, and the ocean alike. So much for blue skies and clear water beaches. Even the sand seems to be burned with the rich orange. The good thing is that we love sunsets and we are all here for it. What a beauty.</p>
